# CS_3113_Assignment_2
Pong Game Variation:
 This game allows single player and multiplayer modes with multiplayer mode being default.
 If you press on the key "t", it will switch to single player mode. Item boxes will spawn
 at pseudo-random locations (so not completely random), and once the ball hits the item,
 your paddle will increase while decreasing your opponent's paddle. You can only reach a
 certain size. The ball will speed up and so will your paddle movement. Once the ball hits
 your opponent side, you win and the game is over.
